# py_dem

## Description
This is a collection of multiple small python projects.

Those projects are:
- battleships\

   The popular game battleships, implemented with a console
   version, and a GUI-Version. The GUI-Version was created
   using pygame, and can be started when launching with the
   console argument '--gui'.
- huffman_coding\

   A quick implementation of the Huffman-Coding algorithm.
   This can be used in any python program, or as a standalone,
   as it has been implemented properly in a module format.
   It's general purpose is to compress .txt files down in to
   .huff files of about half the original size, and vice versa.
